## tvprogram adapter for ioBroker

This adapter polls information about the television program at regular intervals. 
The data can be displayed in various widgets. 

The adapter is still in an alpha phase in which widgets / functions are still being tested, 
functions / widgets can be added and removed or completely exchanged.

References to issues or feature requests can be left or 
discussed in the iobroker forum in the corresponding thread

## Developer manual
The adapter can currently only be installed via github. This can be done in the iobroker in the "adapter" tab, 
with the expert view via the github button (cat symbol).

Then enter the url of the github repository https://github.com/oweitman/iobroker.tvprogram in the "any" tab and install it.

### Adapter Configuration

No configuration currently required

### Widgets

Widgets are supported only in modern browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Safari).
Not supported Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge without Chromium (Version <79).

#### Time
This widget shows the current TV program on a timeline by TV channel.

To set it up, the adapter must have already accessed and filled the necessary data. 
Due to its size, the data is not stored in data points but in files and in the adapter's memory.
In the configuration, the widget only needs to be filled with any data point of the adapter (e.g.config).
The widget searches for all remaining data points automatically.

If the text behind the channel logos shows through, a background color must be selected in the widget.
it is generally a good approach to choose an explicit foreground and background color for the view or at least for the widget.
The Marker position ist updated every 15 seconds.

If something goes wrong after installation and the widget isnt diplayed correctly, please try the following command from shell:

The following attributes are available for configuration in vis

| Attribute             | Example            | Description                                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |

| headerfontpercent     | 125                | Character size in percent for the heading (time)      |
| broadcastfontpercent  | 75                 | Character size in percent for the broadcasts          |
| highlightcolor        | yellow             | color for the favorites                               |
| markerpositionpercent | 25                 | Position of the Marker in percent ot the widget width |
| dialogwidthpercent    | 90                 | size of the dialogs in percent of the widget          |
| dialogheightpercent   | 90                 | size of the dialogs in percent of the widget          |

##### CSS-Classes
Please change w00001 to your widget ID

To Change the formatting of the dialogs

```css
#w00001channeldlg {
    background-color: red !important;
}
```

```css
#w00001broadcastdlg {
    background-color: red !important;
}
```

If you use some extra dialogs with other z-index-setting you can set highet z-index for the tvprogram dialogs. 
Maybe you have to set a higher number than 300. This depends on settings in other dialogs which overlap or hide the tvprogram (broadcast info and channel select) dialogs

```css
.ui-dialog.w00001 {
   z-index:300 !important;
}
```

To Change the formatting of the alternating background colors of the broadcasts
```css
#w00001 .scrollcontainer ul.tv-row:nth-child(odd)> li.broadcast:nth-child(odd),#w00001 ul.tv-row:nth-child(odd)> li.time:nth-child(odd) {
   background-color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.65);
}
#w00001 .scrollcontainer ul.tv-row:nth-child(odd)> li.broadcast:nth-child(even),#w00001 ul.tv-row:nth-child(odd)> li.time:nth-child(even) {
   background-color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.55);
}
#w00001 .scrollcontainer ul.tv-row:nth-child(even)> li.broadcast:nth-child(odd) {
   background-color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.45);
}
#w00001 .scrollcontainer ul.tv-row:nth-child(even)> li.broadcast:nth-child(even) {

- Problem: endless scroll in firefox
- Ideas for further widgets based on the existing TV program script
- Data adapter for other sources (Internet, hardware such as Enigma, VU-Box)
- ~~to be discussed: Datenpunkt, mit allen Aufnahmedaten, should be implementet at a videorecorder adapter or in a seperate script~~
- ~~responsive design for detail view->no responsive design possible for jquery dialog, found another solution with fixed layouts for height>width~~
- ~~Problem: small Pixel glitch if scroll pane is completle on the left side~~
